# Experience
See [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminswoolley/) for more detail.

## ITV (Current)
A more functional Scala team, using http4s with Circe with heavy use of microservices and event-driven services (SQS consumers and AWS Lambda).

## Hotels.com (July 2017 - August 2020)
### Software Developer 1 (August 2018 - August 2020)
I have additionally been carrying out coding interviews for Java and Scala roles under this role.

#### Scala team (November 2018 - August 2020)
A team solely working in Scala, maintaining both dateful and dateless pricing services in addition to pre-select. The team prefers pair programming as a default and I've been enjoying this as a practice.

* Contributed to the migration of the oldest application from Spring MVC to Finatra. I spiked the problem and created the plan of action to carry out the migration without slowing down development or compromising test coverage.

#### Java team (August 2018 - November 2018)
Working in a pillar overcoming the teething issues of migrating to a microservice architecture:
* Contributed towards a cross-team decision to move towards concrete fields in APIs vs propagating a `String -> String` map for experimental features.
* Designed a new endpoint for the internal images endpoint. This included a feature intended for use by a cross-pillar team - balancing the delay of the project against the future technical debt of delivering for the other team just-in-time.

### Associate Software Developer (July 2017 - August 2018)
#### Java team (primary)
#### Kotlin team (6 months)
Working in a tiger team to write a new microservice to:
  * Extract common price display logic from front-end applications
  * Create a single source of truth of world-wide price display rules
  * Enable rapid testing of new price displays by providing a method to use the existing MVT framework.
  * Enable the creation of price displays that were impossible in the existing system.

### Industrial Placement Student (September 2015 - September 2016)
Working in a tiger team to write a new microservice to replace a legacy pricing system that was heavily integrated into the front-end applications.

# Recreation
I also:
* Teach [Java to beginners](https://ben-woolley.github.io/java-for-beginners-docs/) internally every quarter
* Bake (I bake for my team *hint hint*)
* Run (or at least try)
* Play video games
